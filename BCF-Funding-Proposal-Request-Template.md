# ![BCF Logo Round Tiny](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The-Bitcoin-Cash-Fund/Branding/master/BCF%20Symbol%20Round%20Tiny.png) BCF Funding Proposal Request Template


**Project Name:** excha8nger


**Start Date:** github repo 28.11.2017


**Hashtag:** #bitcoincashxchngr


**Name of BCF Gitter community room:** ezXch8nger


**Stakeholders:** 
only me right now


**Project Summary:** 

1)I am located in Malaysia and like many other countries crypto is still very new and beginning to get some traction. The only possible way to get into crypto right now is via bank trasnfer to a service provider wallet (i.e luno etc) and vice versa. The third party usually has presence here in Malaysia and has set up a company and bank account to receive those funds. Usually if not most of the time these wallets offer fiat->BTC and BTC->fiat conversion and direct bank transfers. So far there isnt one that accepts BitcoinCash Fiat conversions.
2)Recently, the Central Bank of Malaysia, released a statement saying that they will regulate the exchange from crypto to fiat by appointing "individuals" to comply with AML reguations. In Malaysia we have what we call traditional Money Changers, who are in essence small business owners who offer fiat currency exchange, you could go to a bank too, but these money changers are found almost everywhere and convenient, and on top of that they are already licensed and follow strict Central Banks procedures.
3)The project is to work with these traditional money changers and offer them a platform to conduct BitcoinCash conversions to fiat as an added service.

**Goals:**

[Insert a list of clearly defined list of goals including: 
    - traditional money changers  
    - 100-200k people
    - In the Kuala Lumpur City to start
    - The most logical step for the traditional money changer is to accept BitcoinCash the true peer2peer electronic cash


**Other:**

I am 43 years old, married with a 1 year old son. I have an Economic and Finance backround, and have run an engineering based business since January this year. Ever since January and finding crypto and blockchain and BitcoinCash, my resolve is to contribute and to spread the word of this fantastic tech!

## Use S.M.A.R.T Principles When writing the BCF FPR

**S** - **Specific** - Well defined. Clear to anyone that has a basic knowledge of the project

**M** - **Measurable** - Know if the goal is obtainable. Find out when you have achieved your goal

**A** - **Agreed Upon** - Agreement with all the stakeholders what the goals should be.

**R** - **Realistic** - Within the availability of resources, knowledge and time.

**T** - **Time-bound** - Enough time to achieve the goal. Not too much time, which can affect project performance


## BCF FPR Requirements

- A completed FPR must be included as to a project's github repo as the first commit/PR as an md file. This will help guide the project, and anyone who joins it can quickly find out the most important information.
- Any print media the BCF funds with either dimension over 40mm must have the BCF round logo on it somewhere.
- Any print media the BCF funds with either dimension over 100mm must have the logos of our Tier 3 sponsors on it somewhere.
- Any video projects the BCF funds must include the BCF Bitcoin Cash animation at the beginning or end of the video.
- Any video projects the BCF funds must include our tier 2 and tier 3 sponsors at the end of the video.
- The BCF reserves the right to not fund any project at it's own discretion.

## What isn't the Bitcoin Cash Fund for.

- Funds will not be given to companies just to further their business. Companies are welcome to submit an FPR as long as it is for a specific project that attempts to directly increase awareness and adoption of Bitcoin Cash.
- Funds will not be paid to individuals or businesses simply because they want money.
- Funds will not be paid for BCH protocol development (at this time).
